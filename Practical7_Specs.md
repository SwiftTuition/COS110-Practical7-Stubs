### 2 Overview

Template classes allow programmers to define class blueprints which work with different data types. This makes more flexible and reusable as the class does not need to be rewritten to work with different data types. This can be particularly powerful when used in conjunction with class hierarchies, sine template classes can serve as base or derived classes, enabling polymorphism while still taking advantage of the template features.

### 3 Template Compiling

There are many different approaches to compile and use templates in c++. For this practical you have to follow the following approach, as the header files will be overwritten on Fitchfork and will only work with this approach. The approach used is the approach on Slide 7 of Week 9 Lecture 3. This approach is:

*   At the bottom of the header file (but before the #endif) include the implementation file.
*   When you want to use a class in a different file, only include the header file.
*   When compiling your code, don't compile the template classes.
*   Optional: In the implementation file you are allowed to include the header file at the top to allow auto complete to work for most IDE's.

### 4 Your Task:

You are required to implement the following class diagram illustrated in Figure 1. Pay close attention to the function signatures as the h files will be overwritten, thus failure to comply with the UML, will result in a mark of 0.

[Figure 1: Class diagrams]

Note, the importance of the arrows between the classes are not important for COS 110 and will be expanded on in COS 214.

#### 4.4 RandomStrategy

This is a template class inheriting publically from the Storage class. It will use a random number generator to traverse the array. This will be implemented using a Lienar Congruential Generator which mimics the random number generator found in gcc.

[Figure 5: RandomStrategy UML]

##### 4.4.1 Members

    *   Initialise this variable to 12345.
*   Member 3
    *   This is a variable used by the random number generator.
    *   Initialise this variable to 2147483648.

##### 4.4.2 Functions

*   Function 1
    *   Call the parent constructor using the passed-in parameter.
*   Function 2
    *   This is a virtual function.
    *   This function will add the passed-in value at the next empty spot in the array.
    *   To find the next empty spot, use the random number algorithm explained in Section 4.4.3.
    *   If an empty spot cannot be found, then don't add the passed-in value.
*   Function 3
    *   This is a virtual function.
    *   This function will remove the passed-in value from the array. Only remove the first occurrence of the data.
    *   To search for the passed-in value, use the random number algorithm explained in Section 4.4.3.
    *   If the passed-in value is found, then delete that index in the array, and set it equal to NULL.
*   Function 4
    *   This is a virtual function.
    *   This function will return the index of the first occurrence of the passed-in value in the array.
    *   To search for the passed-in value, use the random number algorithm explained in Section 4.4.3.
    *   If the passed-in value is found, return that index of the first matching value.
    *   If the passed-in value was not found, return -1.

##### 4.4.3 Generating random numbers

*   This random number generator works by using a sequence starting from an initial value, called a seed. The seed for our algorithm will be the size of the array.
*   Every time a function needs a random number the sequence will reset, to ensure that we can find the elements again.
*   The random value is stored in an int variable called r. This value is initialised to the size of the array. When using the random value to look up values in the array, take the variable r and use the modulus operator with the size of the array to cap the value to a valid index.
*   Every time you need a new random value, update r using the formula
    `r = |(a Ã— r + c)%m|`
*   To prevent infinite loops, the random number generator should only generate 3 \* array size numbers.
*   Example:
    *   Create a RandomStrategy object with a size of 2. Call the getIndex function with any input parameter. Since there are no elements in the array, it will generate the maximum number of random numbers and then return -1. The generated random numbers are:

| Iteration | r          | index |
| :-------- | :--------- | :---- |
| 1         | 2087924461 | 1     |
| 2         | 1495329502 | 0     |
| 3         | 4707519    | 1     |
| 4         | 203552652  | 0     |
| 5         | 2043986219 | 1     |
| 6         | 78875016   | 0     |

    *   Call the parent constructor using the passed-in parameter.
*   Function 2
    *   This is a virtual function.
    *   This function will add the passed-in value at the next empty spot in the array.
    *   To find the next empty spot, use the algorithm explained in Section 4.5.2.
    *   If an empty spot cannot be found, then don't add the passed-in value.
*   Function 3
    *   This is a virtual function.
    *   This function will remove the passed-in value from the array. Only remove the first occurrence of the data.
    *   To search for the passed-in value, use the algorithm explained in Section 4.5.2.
    *   If the passed-in value is found, then delete that index in the array, and set it equal to NULL.
*   Function 4
    *   This is a virtual function.
    *   This function will return the index of the first occurrence of the passed-in value in the array.

    *   If the passed-in value is found, return that index of the first matching value.
    *   If the passed-in value was not found, return -1.

##### 4.5.2 Generating Fibonacci numbers

*   This sequence generator will use the Fibonacci sequence to pick the traversal order. If you need a reminder about the Fibonacci sequence please read up about it here.
*   Every time a function needs a number the sequence will reset, to ensure that we can find the elements again. When using the Fibonacci number to look up values in the array, take the variable and use the modulus operator with the size of the array to cap the value to a valid index.
*   To prevent infinite loops, the number generator should only generate 3 \* array size numbers.
*   Example:
    *   Create a FibonacciStrategy object with a size of 2. Call the getIndex function with any input parameter. Since there are no elements in the array, it will generate the maximum number of numbers and then return -1. The generated numbers are:

| Iteration | v | index |
| :-------- | :-| :---- |
| 1         | 0 | 0     |
| 2         | 1 | 1     |
| 3         | 1 | 1     |
| 4         | 2 | 0     |
| 5         | 3 | 1     |
| 6         | 5 | 1     |

### 5 Memory Management

As memory management is a core part of COS110 and C++, each task on FitchFork will allocate approximately 10% of the marks to memory management. The following command is used:

`valgrind --leak-check=full ./main`

Please ensure, at all times, that your code correctly de-allocates all the memory that was allocated.

### 6 Testing

As testing is a vital skill that all software developers need to know and be able to perform daily, 10% of the assignment marks will be allocated to your testing skills. To do this, you will need to submit a testing main (inside the main.cpp file) that will be used to test an Instructor Provided solution. You may add any helper functions to the main.cpp file to aid your testing. In order to determine the coverage of your testing the gcov Â¹ tool, specifically the following version gcov (Debian 8.3.0-6) 8.3.0, will be used. The following set of commands will be used to run gcov:

`g++ --coverage *.cpp -o main`
`./main`
`gcov -f -m -r -j ${files}`

This will generate output which we will use to determine your testing coverage. The following coverage ratio will be used:

number of lines executed
\--------------------------
number of source code lines

We will scale this ration based on class size.

The mark you will receive for the testing coverage task is determined using Table 1:

| Coverage ratio range | % of testing mark |
| :------------------- | :---------------- |
| 0%-5%                | 0%                |
| 5%-20%               | 20%               |
| 20%-40%              | 40%               |
| 40%-60%              | 60%               |
| 60%-80%              | 80%               |
| 80%-100%             | 100%              |
Table 1: Mark assignment for testing

Note the top boundary for the Coverage ratio range is not inclusive except for 100%. Also, note that only the functions stipulated in this specification will be considered to determine your testing

Â¹For more information on gcov please see https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Gcov.html

mark. Remember that your main will be testing the Instructor Provided code and as such, it can only be assumed that the functions outlined in this specification are defined and implemented.

**As you will be receiving marks for your testing main, we will also be doing plagiarism checks on your testing main.**

### 7 Implementation Details

*   You must implement the functions in the header files exactly as stipulated in this specification. Failure to do so will result in compilation errors on FitchFork.
*   You may only use c++98.
*   You may only utilize the specified libraries. Failure to do so will result in compilation errors on FitchFork.
*   You may only use the following libraries:
    *   cmath
    *   iostream
    *   sstream
*   You are supplied with a trivial main demonstrating the basic functionality of this assessment.

### 8 Upload Checklist

The following c++ files should be in a zip archive named uXXXXXXXX.zip where XXXXXXXX is your student number:

*   Storage.cpp
*   ForwardStrategy.cpp

The files should be in the root directory of your zip file. In other words, when you open your zip file you should immediately see your files. They should not be inside another folder.

### 9 Submission

You need to submit your source files on the FitchFork website (https://ff.cs.up.ac.za/). All methods need to be implemented (or at least stubbed) before submission. Your code should be able to be compiled with the following command:

`g++ -Werror -Wall *.cpp -o main`

and run with the following command:

`./main`

Remember your h file will be overwritten, so ensure you do not alter the provided h files. You have 10 submissions and your best mark will be your final mark. Upload your archive to the Practical 7 slot on the FitchFork website. If you submit after the deadline but before the late deadline, a 20% mark deduction will be applied. **No submissions after the late deadline will be accepted!**
